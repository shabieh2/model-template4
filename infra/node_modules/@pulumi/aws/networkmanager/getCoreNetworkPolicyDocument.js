/**
 * Generates a Core Network policy document in JSON format for use with resources that expect core network policy documents such as `awsccNetworkmanagerCoreNetwork`. It follows the API definition from the [core-network-policy documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/cloudwan/cloudwan-policies-json.html).
 *
 * Using this data source to generate policy documents is *optional*. It is also valid to use literal JSON strings in your configuration or to use the `file` interpolation function to read a raw JSON policy document from a file.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Basic Example
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const test = aws.networkmanager.getCoreNetworkPolicyDocument({
 *     attachmentPolicies: [
 *         {
